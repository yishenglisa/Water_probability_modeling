Scripts in this folder are used to find the most probable positions of water molecule given a structural element of interest.
'place_all_full_protein.py' places water molecules onto the structure of interest. It generates two npys files: 
'f{pdb}_all_out_coord_test_50000_wat_new_analysis.npy', which includes coordinates of all water molecules.
and f'{pdb}_normalization_{norm}_50000_wat_new_analysis.npy', which includes normalization information for each water molecules.
'KDE_full_protein.py' performs kernel density estimation on each water molecule; in addition, 'visualize_water.py' makes pdb files of "solvated structural 
element" with -log(KDE) in the bfactor columne for easy visualization in PyMOL.
'HDBSCAN.py' picks cutoff for KDE and performs density clustering on filtered data (water molecule with KDE above some given threshold), and makes pdb 
files with the water molecules at the most probable position. 


In addition, in 'analysis_function.py':
We made 'buiild_density_pdb' function for visualizing each water molecule with its KDE in PyMOL;
I fixed the 'rigid_transform_3D' function to ensure a right-handed coordinate system, but haven't tested it.
